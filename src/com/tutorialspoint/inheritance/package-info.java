/**
 * Contains some examples about Inheritance topic.
 *
 * <p>
 * When we talk about inheritance, the most commonly used keyword would be <b>extends</b> and
 * <b>implements</b>. These words would determine whether one object <b>IS-A</b> type of another. By
 * using these keywords we can make one object acquire the properties of another object.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <b>HAS-A </b> relationships are mainly based on the usage. This determines whether a certain
 * class <b>HAS-A </b> certain thing. This relationship helps to reduce duplication of code as well
 * as bugs.
